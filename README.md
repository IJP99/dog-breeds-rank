DOG BREEDS ANALYSIS

In this project we analyze the different dog breeds that the dataset contains with the final objective of open a ficticious dog cafe.

The initial analysis goes with creating the tables for the 2 tables that we create for the analysis in MySQL.
Then we start to use filters and export the output of our final result to python to create the list using seaborn and matplot.

The result from MySQL where first of all about the sociability of the different dog breeds then analysis of the dogs attention-required levels and finally the general score with all the variables

Then after creating the graphs of the mentioned variables we get 6 different dogs that were the leaders in terms of sociability and we use "Where" attribute in the next MySQL analysis to reduce the output for that 6 dogs and get outputs about:
    - Lifetime cost of each dog breeds
    - Popularity of each dog breed and how well received the are for the people
    - Genetic ailments that dogs may suffer from
    - Longevity years that each dog breed has in general

Then we get into conclusions.
