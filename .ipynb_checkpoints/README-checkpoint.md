ECONOMIC FREEDOM

This proyect analyze the dataframe provided by FRASER INSTITUTE and analyze and clean this dataframe with the objective to give a better understanding of each variable inside of it, after that use the seaborn library to gives graphs examples of this variables.

The dataframe used was a dataframe analysing the economic freedom index of all the countries under some aspects or variables. Because of the lengh of different variables I want to give a better understanding of each one by first cleaning this dataframe.
To do that I first met with a common problem import an excel file into a dataframe in python:

- Columns without name
- Rows with only NaN values
- Manipulation of data difficult due to the type or similarities

My aimed objective was to get a better understanding of each variable as I said trying to create new columns that reflect the big groups were you can allocate the more than 40 different variables.
